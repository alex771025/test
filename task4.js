//Even Numbers from 1 to 20
//Goal: Loop through a range of numbers and filter even numbers.

//Task: Write a program that prints all the even numbers between 1 and 20.

//Hint: Use an if statement inside the loop to check if a number is even (i % 2 === 0).
for(let i = 1; i<= 20; i++){
    if(i % 2 ===0){
        console.log(i);
    }
}
