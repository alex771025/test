//Task: Count from 1 to 5 (Using while loop)
//Goal: Use a while loop to count from 1 to 5 and print each number.

///ask: Write a program that uses a while loop to print the numbers from 1 to 5, one on each line.

//Hint: Initialize a variable (e.g., i) to 1, then keep increasing it by 1 on each iteration of the while loop, until it reaches 5.
let i = 1;
while(i <= 5){
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}
